# CS Abstracts Dataset
Dataset of scientific abstracts for the purpose of sentence classification. The abstracts are from the Computer Science, 

The dataset is composed by a total of 654 abstracts, which were collected from the arXiv platform, and all the abstracts are from the Computer Science field (hence the name CS Abstracts). Then, using a crowdsourcing and collective inteligence, the data was annotated, where the sentences where categorized in the following classes:
- Background
- Objective
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions

The following table details composition of the dataset, with respective numbers of abstracts and sentences splitted by training set, validation set and test set:

|            | Training set | Validation set | Test set |
|------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| #abstracts | 500          | 77             | 77       |
| #sentences | 3287         | 824            | 619      |

The dataset is split in three files (train.txt, validation.txt and test.txt).

This dataset was developed in the context of my Master Thesis in Engineering and Management of Information Systems.
